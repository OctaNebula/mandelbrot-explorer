# mandelbrot-explorer
A simple Mandelbrot set explorer written in Python using matplotlib and numpy, built on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Written for a maths project in school.

Huge thanks to [Danyaal Rangwala](https://github.com/danyaal) for a very easy to understand [implementation of the Mandelbrot set in Python](https://github.com/danyaal/mandelbrot).

# Usage

To run the webapp, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Alternatively, you can use a pre-deployed version of the app - https://mandelbrot.octanebula.dev
